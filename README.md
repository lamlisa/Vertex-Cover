# Vertex-Cover
In collaboration with Bruno Pinto a.k.a. pintob https://github.com/pintob \
Given an undirected graph G=(V,E), where V is the set of vertices and E the set of edges of G. A cover of G is a set such as all the edges is incident to at least one vertex of V.\
The purpose of this project is to find the cover with minimum number of vertices. 
We will then implement and analyze a few algorithm (exacts and approximated) to solve this problem.
